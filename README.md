# Android Task List App

Never again forget the tasks you need to complete or the events you need to attend. This task and event manager allows you to save your tasks and organize them on the basis of their priority. It also allows you to manage your events systematically. For every event it also shows you how much time you have before the event so that you can constantly be aware of it and make better preparations for that event.

In short, this is a really simplistic and concise app to help you manage your time better, and it never lets you forget your important tasks or events.
